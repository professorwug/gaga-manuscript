The turntable was rotated through 360 degrees to vary object pose with respect to a fixed camera. Images of the objects were taken at pose intervals of 5 degrees. This corresponds to 72 images per object. The database has two sets of images. The first set contains 720 unprocessed images of 10 objects. The second contains 1440 size normalized images of 20 objects. COIL-20 is available online via ftp.},
